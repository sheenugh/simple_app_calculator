# simple_app_calculator
This repository is for OOP Program 5. In addition, this repository is all about creating a simple calculator GUI application using Tkinter module with the inclusion of python functions or methods, and the 'try and except' of exception handling. However, creating this has certain grounds or reminders, and these are:
1. The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
2. The application will ask the user for two numbers
3. Display the result
4. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.
5. If yes, repeat Step 1.
6. If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit
7. Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during
 runtime.
